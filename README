This Python program pulls stock prices from Yahoo Finance and updates a spreadsheet with current market prices.
It has been tested with Openoffice and Libreoffice but not Excel.
It can be a bit slow, so the user is notified of completion by a small pop-up window.

Input your stocks ticker symbol in the tickerList on line 47.
Put the path to your spreadsheet in the filePath variable on line 48. Note that all formulas and formatting will be lost when the spreadsheet updates.
  I use an otherwise blank document for this and link those cells with my primary document.
