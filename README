STOCK UPDATE
This Python program pulls stock prices from Yahoo Finance and updates a spreadsheet with current market prices.
It has been tested with Openoffice and Libreoffice but not Excel.
It can be a bit slow, so the user is notified of completion by a small pop-up window.

DEPENDENCIES
Install the following via PIP:
yfinance
xlrd
xlutils 

USING THE PROGRAM
Input your stocks' ticker symbols in the tickerList list on line 47.
Put the path to your spreadsheet in the filePath variable on line 48. 
Note that all formulas and formatting will be lost when the spreadsheet updates.
I use an otherwise blank document for this and link those cells with my primary document.
To disable the popup, delete or comment out line 64.

MISC
In addition to this program, I created button/macro in my primary spreadsheet that executes a batch file that calls getTicker_all.py.
Of course this can also be automated with Task Scheduler.
